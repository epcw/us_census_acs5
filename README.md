# US Census API wrapper

## Description
Shell-script based Webscraper to pull data from the US Census 5-year American Community Survey.

## Getting started:
* This is written in Bash a unix shell script.  Windows users, you can do this through a Bash for Windows utility (I recommend [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/); it is free and open source)
* This assumes a Unix/Linux based filesystem.  For Windows, change the download and file directories accordingly (specifically, replace the "~" home directory with wherever you are working in Windows).
* You WILL NEED a US Census API key to access this API.  [Get a free one from the Census Bureau here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)
* You will need to replace the variables and the geographies in the script with whatever you want to pull.  Multiple ones can be searched with one run of the script.
